# 🧺 A Catcher Game for gwc

This project is made using p5.js + p5.play and it is a arcade style game where the user has to catch falling circles using a basket. And they have to earn points by catching them and not letting too many fall, or else they lose!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

* Use the left ⬅️ and right ➡️ arrow keys to move the basket.
* Catch the falling objects to gain points.
* Each catch will give you +1 point and missing one will subtract -1 point.
* You have to reach 15 points to win or fall to -5 points to lose.

## 🌟 Features

There is a custom background and also a basket as a catcher. Random colored falling circles that have different speeds and a collision detector which supports the score tracking to increase and decrease points.

## 🧠 I Learned

How to move an object with the arrow keys, how to increase or decrease points by detecting sprite collision.
And in future I plan to add more features to it like a win loose statement
